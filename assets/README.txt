On default: Place your images here (assets/images/) and thumbnails in (assets/thumbs). Make sure to resize them to something like 1600*1200 to increase perfomance!
Make sure the image format is in jpg, jpeg, gif or png!

IMPORTANT: For now the thumbnails of the images have to be named thumb_Imagename and be in jpg, jpeg, gif or png format!
EXAMPLE: Image name is IMGP7001.jpg then your thumbnail needs to be named thumb_IMGP7001.jpg

On default: Place your thumbnails here. Make sure to use proper thumbnails sizes (~300px) to decrease loading times 

(if you want to use an other place you can delete the assets folder and set your location in the config file!)
